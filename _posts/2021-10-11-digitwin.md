Worked as a R&D intern.

Implemented a system that uses one drone server to control a swarm of DJI Tello drones. The drone server received commands for drones from a smart-city server, sent those commands to the drones which then took pictures of the surroundings and uploaded the pictures and coordination data to the smart-city server via FTP.

The two servers communicated via MQTT, a standard messaging protocol for IoT.
