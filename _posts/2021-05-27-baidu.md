Worked as a backend intern.

Developed an interactive web interface between the game server and the client side, supporting the transmission of database information between the two.

Used Swagger (a tool for generating HTTP interface documents) to generate code documents automatically, and then used Swagger UI to generate a web UI to show the code documents.

Implemented a user management system with web UI, including features such as user registration/login, admin functions such as account addition/deletion/modification, etc.
